# MIRP is not maintained nor developed anymore.
The project had its flaws and problems and the development stopped in 2020. Sorry, I'm not planning on updating it and if it doesn't work for you, try looking for better alternatives, of which, I'm pretty sure, there are many.
This repository was initially made to host the MIRP webpage. The source code added in /src is of the latest (v1.6.8.3, 31.07.2020) version, written in Object Pascal with LCL.
